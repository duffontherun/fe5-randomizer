# fe5-randomizer
The 5th Fire Emblem game, Fire Emblem Thracia 776, was originally released on the Japanese Super Famicom on September 1st, 1999. Despite not having a complete English Translation, it has this randomizer. How in the hell this happened is probobly a result of some translators being incompetent or something, idfk (It does have a translation as of this commit however).

This program will randomize certain gameplay elements of FE5 to create a new experience every time. It includes a variety of options, such as: Unit Classes, Unit Bases, Unit Growths, Items, etc. It also has a patch that you can choose to apply to remove the weapon locks that make it so only a specific set of characters can use certain weapons. The only exception is certain dark tomes that can only be used by the enemy which will always have this applied to them.

This program DOES NOT translate the ROM. 

Feel free to repurpose this randomizer for other games as well. See LICENSE for more details.
